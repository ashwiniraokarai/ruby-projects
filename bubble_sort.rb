# Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.

# optimization one:
# at the end of every iteration you have one element that found its sorted position i.e., bubbled up to the right end
# so you have one less element to process in the following iteration

# optimization two:
# using a tracking variable, track any swaps in a full iteration
# at the end of an iteration, if tracking variable is still 0 it means there was not a single swap which mean array is already sorted
# so you can stop iterating further
